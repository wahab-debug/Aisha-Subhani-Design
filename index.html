            After graduating from the Central Institute of Arts and Craft in Karachi, Pakistan, Fazal Ahmed- a graphic
            Designer turned artist, embarked on his creative journey as a sculptor, painter, jewellery artist , and
            multidisciplinary artist. Over the past two decades, he has refined his unique artistic voice, establishing
            himself as one of Pakistan’s most compelling and distinctive talents.

            Fazal works with clay as one of his primary mediums, shaping it with remarkable skill and imaginative flair.
            His hands bring life to the material, transforming simple earth into expressive forms that reflect cultural
            narratives and personal symbolism. Each piece is a testament to his deep understanding of texture, form, and
            movement.

            In addition to his sculptural work, Fazal is also known for his intricately crafted sculpted jewellery. Each
            piece is more than an accessory—it is a miniature artwork, that blends artistic elegance with wearable form,
            turning everyday adornment into a bold expression of identity and creativity.

            A recurring theme in Fazal’s recent 3D and relief sculptures is Confined. Through haunting imagery of
            blindfolded faces and exaggerated, distorted limbs, his works express a powerful commentary on
            psychological, societal, and emotional restrictions. These sculptures evoke a sense of struggle, silence,
            and suppression—giving form to what is often left unspoken. Fazal carefully selects mediums such as white
            ceramic clay and terracotta clay for each piece, chosen for their texture, tone, and expressive potential.
            After undergoing the transformative process of kiln firing, some works are further elevated with delicate
            touches of gold leaf, adding contrast and symbolic richness to the final form.

            His broader body of work draws on African and Aboriginal aesthetics, merging these influences with a vibrant
            colour palette to produce pieces that are both visually arresting . Fazal’s innovative approach and bold
            style have positioned him as a thought-provoking presence in the contemporary art scene.

            Fazal has exhibited his work in prominent galleries across Dubai,UAE and Pakistan. His exhibitions have been
            praised for their emotional intensity and for challenging viewers to confront themes of identity,
            confinement, and transformation.
          </div>
          <div class="card-art">
            “Confined” is a compelling relief sculpture composed of numerous expressive faces meticulously crafted from
            white ceramic clay. Each face is encased in an oval, cocoon-like form, evoking a sense of individual
            entrapment. These forms are systematically arranged in a tight grid within a deep, shadow-box frame, giving
            the illusion of both physical and psychological confinement. The faces, though similar in structure, each
            display subtle differences in expression—some neutral, others anguished or distorted—conveying a broad
            emotional spectrum trapped within uniform boundaries.
            The use of white ceramic clay enhances the piece's starkness and purity while also invoking themes of
            silence, anonymity, and sterility. The matte, unglazed surface contributes to the raw, organic feel of the
            work, allowing the emotional resonance of each face to stand out without distraction. The repetitive
            arrangement emphasizes a loss of individuality, as though the figures are prisoners of an invisible system,
            silently screaming from behind their ceramic enclosures.
            Among the predominantly white faces, a few are rendered in deep black, sharply breaking the visual rhythm
            and drawing immediate attention. These dark elements act as visual disruptions—perhaps representing moments
            of despair, difference, or rebellion against conformity. Their presence challenges the uniformity and
            underscores the psychological tension that permeates the piece.
            “Confined” is not merely a visual experience but an emotional one. It speaks to the human condition—our
            inner struggles, societal pressures, and the quiet pain of isolation. The viewer is invited to confront the
            reality of what it means to feel boxed in, both physically and emotionally. In its stillness, the piece
            evokes a loud, collective voice—one that resonates with anyone who has ever felt unseen, unheard, or
            emotionally constrained. Through its minimalist yet poignant design, “Confined” becomes a powerful
            reflection on identity, constraint, and the longing for release.

            Karachi-based artist Amna Fraz, educated at the National College of Arts, skillfully integrates age-old
            techniques with a contemporary vision.
            Channeling the creative energies of the world around us, Amna crafts her own pigments by refining minerals
            and rocks to extract colours of unparalleled purity and vibrancy.
            Her work reflects tangible connections, linking us to our surroundings. It is an expression of the world's
            artistry, underscoring the depth and complexity of our shared environment and a celebration of the cosmos
            that we are all a part of, elementally connected to nature and its infinite wonders.
            A reminder to slow down and reconnect. Ajami Art, representative of the pinnacle of Islamic prosperity, was
            cultivated in Damascus, which stood as one of the world's most prosperous and culturally diverse commercial
            centers, influencing artistic styles and embracing trends. The Ajami Room reflects this era with a
            distinctive technique where artists applied a thick paste made of gypsum and animal glue that, once dried,
            created raised ornamentation. These elements were further enhanced with gold leaf and painted over in egg
            tempera.
            Inspired by these opulent historical interiors, my work seeks to blend traditional craft with a modern
            sensibility while remaining faithful to its methods and materials. Central to my artistic practice is the
            use of natural pigments—vivid colors drawn from minerals and earth, such as blue from lapis lazuli,
            vermillion from cinnabar, and green from malachite. These practices not only connect peoples and eras but
            also deepen our appreciation for craftsmanship as a bridge linking past and present, prompting reflection on
            the enduring impact of cultural traditions across time and space.
